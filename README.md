# Advent of Code

My solutions to [AOC](https://adventofcode.com) written in Python.

## Running

Run solutions with:

```python -m aoc run 2022 8```

Where the first positional argument is the year and the second positional argument is the day.

The `--small` flag runs the solution for the small data (usually found in the text of the problem). Otherwise the solution for the main data is run.

## Stubbing

Stub out input and solution files with:

```python -m aoc stub 2022 8```

Where the first positional argument is the year and the second positional argument is the day.
